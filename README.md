 Important
-----------

* This style is written for, and will only work with seaweedchan's 4chanX fork available [here] [1].

* To get the board links to display properly, use the custom navigation found in the advanced section of the settings. Click [here] [2] for an example.

* In order to get the "+" (All boards toggle) after BOARDS you must have "toggle-all" in the Custom Board Navigation

Installation (assuming Firefox)
-------------------------------

* Install the Stylish extension to manage your userstyles; once installed, just click on "Write New Style", give it a name, and paste the CSS there.

If you don't use Firefox, you'll have to adapt the 4chan stylesheet so it does not make any reference to the Gecko engine (lines starting with "-moz") and uses the corresponding WebKit property. Note that since there are multiple websites affected by the stylesheet, each defined using @-moz-document, you might have to split the stylesheet in different parts.
