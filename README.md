材料 - ZAIRYŌ
-----------

* This style is written to work with ccd'0s 4chanX fork available [here] [1].

* Big thanks to [mudanaku] [2] for updating and fixing this style.

* To get the board links to display properly, use the custom navigation found in the advanced section of the settings. Click [here] [3] for an example.

* Sadly, many parts of the stylesheet break when used on Chrome. I may get around to fixing it one day, but I wouldn't count on it. Sorry.

* Toggle the sidebar by toggling header auto-hide (Default keybind is shift + h).

* Click "掲示板" to open the full board list.

* Click "見てのスレッド" to open the thread watcher menu.

Installation (assuming Firefox)
-------------------------------

* Install the Stylish extension to manage your userstyles; once installed, just click on "Write New Style", give it a name, and paste the CSS there.
* CTRL + F 'FILE GOES HERE'
* replace with a path to your 1920*64 header image

TODO LIST
-------------------------------
* fix picture captcha popout
* fix broken catalog
* get better header image
