材料 - ZAIRYŌ
-----------

* This style is written only to work with ccd'0s 4chanX fork.

* This style currently only works on firefox.

* Big thanks to [mudanaku] [2] for updating and fixing this style.

* To get the board links to display properly, use the custom navigation found in the advanced section of the settings. Click [here] [3] for an example.

* Toggle the sidebar by toggling header auto-hide (Default keybind is shift + h).

* Click "掲示板" to open the full board list.

* Click "見てのスレッド" to open the thread watcher menu.

* Press 'Q' to open quick reply.

Installation
-------------------------------

* Install [ccd0's 4chanX] [1] userscript. 
* Install the [Stylish] [6] extension. 
* Navigate to the userstyles section of the [Addons] [4] page. 
* Click on "Write New Style", give it a name, and paste the CSS there. 
* Go into your 4chan X settings.
* Turn OFF 'Persistent QR', 'Thread Hiding Buttons', and 'Reply Hiding Buttons'
* I'm not sure if there are any other settings needed for it to look right, so my settings are [here] [5].

Customization
-------------------------------

CTRL + F 'http://i.imgur.com/2Uw0eQQ.png' and replace it with a path to your own 1920x64 header image or use the ones I left commented.
